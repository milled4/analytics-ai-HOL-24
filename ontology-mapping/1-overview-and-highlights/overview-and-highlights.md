# Introduction

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Generative AI is a fully managed service for seamlessly integrating these versatile language models into a wide range of use cases, including writing assistance, summarization, analysis, and chat.

## About this Workshop

Generative AI can be leveraged to automatically map text data to standardized terminology or lexicon terms, enabling organizations to improve data interoperability, streamline analysis, and unlock valuable insights. This hands-on lab introduces participants to the application of generative AI in data standardization, using healthcare as an industry example. Focusing on radiology imaging procedures, attendees will learn to use advanced language models like Cohere's Command R and Meta's Llama 3 to map diverse procedure names to standardized names and codes. Through practical exercises using synthetic data, participants will gain experience with both interactive chat interfaces and automated API-driven approaches, providing valuable skills for demonstrating the process and understanding factors that drive success.

Estimated Workshop Time: 1 hour 20 minutes

### Objectives

In this workshop, you will learn how to:

* Setup the environment required to access Chat in the Generative AI service.
* Select the model(s) of interest and update relevant parameters.
* Upload a synthetic dataset including lexicon elements and text variants to be mapped.
* Assess the quality of the model response.
* Have a conversation with the data, providing your own text variants to map.
* As time permits, leverage a Jupyter notebook to access models using an API.
